❇️ Regular Expressions (RegEx) are a powerful tool for **pattern matching** and **text manipulation** that allows you to search, extract, replace, or validate strings based on specific patterns.

**(A) `re.search()`**
- Checks if a pattern exists in a string.
- Returns the **first match** (or `None`).

*Code:*
```python
text = "Python is fun"
match = re.search(r"fun", text)
if match:
    print("Found:", match.group())  
```

*Output:*
```html
Found: fun
```

*Code:*
```python
import re
regex = r"([a-zA-Z]+) (\d+)"

match = re.search(regex, "I was born on June 2")
if match != None:
    print ("Match at index %s, %s" % (match.start(), match.end()))
    print ("Full match: %s" % (match.group(0)))
    print ("Month: %s" % (match.group(1)))
    print ("Day: %s" % (match.group(2)))

else:
    print ("The regex pattern does not match.")
```

*Output:*
```html
Match at index 14, 20
Full match: June 2
Month: June
Day: 2
```

*Explanation:*
- r"..." : Raw string to avoid escaping backslashes (i.e., \n stays as \n).
- ([a-zA-Z]+) : Match one or more letters (uppercase or lowercase). i.e., the month name.
- (\d+) : Match one or more digits i.e., the day number.
- The space '  ' between them : Expect a space between the two parts.
- match.start(), match.end() : Starting & Ending index of match in the string.
- match.group(0) : entire matched string.
- match.group(1) : 1st group of matched string.
- match.group(2) : 2nd group of matched string.

 **(B) `re.findall()`**
- Returns **all matches** as a list.

*Code:*
```python
text = "cats and dogs"
matches = re.findall(r"[a-z]+", text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['cats', 'and', 'dogs']
```

 **(C) `re.sub()`**
- Replaces matches with new text.

*Code:*
```python
text = "Python is awesome"
new_text = re.sub(r"awesome", "great", text)
print(new_text)  # Output: "Python is great"
```

 **(D) `re.split()`**
- Splits a string by a pattern.

*Code:*
```python
text = "apple,banana,cherry"
items = re.split(r",", text)
print(items)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
